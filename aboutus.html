<h1>About Us</h1>
<p> Cup of Change was born in a small kitchen in Cape Town, South Africa, 
   when founder Bradwen Abrahams,
   a former humanitarian aid worker, returned from a trip to rural Ethiopia with two things:<br>
   a bag of freshly roasted coffee beans and a heavy heart.<br>
   He had seen firsthand how coffee farmers worked long hours for little pay,
   often without the resources to expand or improve their yields.<br>
<br>
   Over coffee with friends, Bradwen realized that the problem wasnâ€™t a lack of skill,
   but a lack of opportunity.<br>
   He decided to build a coffee brand that would do more than sell great coffee.<br>
   It would invest directly into farming communities by donating coffee seeds,
   providing training,<br>
   and ensuring farmers received fair payment for their beans.<br>
