<h1>Our Impact</h1>
<img src="img/Sprouts.jpg" height="40%" width="40%">
<h2>Empowering Rural Communities</h2>
    We work hand-in-hand with coffee farmers in rural areas,
    ensuring they are paid fairly and treated with dignity.<br>
    Our partnerships create long-term job opportunities where work is often scarce, 
    giving families the stability they deserve.
<ul>
<li>42 sustainable jobs created for coffee farmers and harvesters.</li>
<li>Fair wages that are 30% above the regional average.</li>
<li>Training programs to help farmers improve crop yields and quality</li>
</ul>

<h2>    Giving Back to Those in Need</h2>
<p>    A portion of every cup you buy goes directly to feeding and supporting vulnerable communities.
<br>
     Together, we’ve turned coffee into a lifeline for many.
<br>
     So far we have:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Donated over R85,000 to local charities and feeding schemes.</li>
<li>Provided 3,500+ warm meals to families living in poverty.</li>
<li>Supported school lunch programs for 120 children across 4 villages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expanding Our Reach</h2>
<p>
    We’re not stopping here. Our vision is to support more farms and communities every year.
    By 2026, we aim to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Create 100+ jobs across 5 new rural farming regions.</li>
<li>Donate over R250,000 to community projects.</li>
<li>Partner with at least 20 schools to provide meals and supplies for children.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Transparency You Can Trust
</h2>

<p>
    We believe in showing exactly where your contribution goes.<br>
    Every month, we publish our donation totals and updates on the lives we’ve touched.
