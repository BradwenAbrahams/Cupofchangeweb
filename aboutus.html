<h1>About Us</h1>
<hr>

<p> Cup of Change was born in a small kitchen in Cape Town, South Africa, 
    when founder Bradwen Abrahams,<br>
    a former humanitarian aid worker, returned from a trip to rural Ethiopia with two things:<br>
    A bag of freshly roasted coffee beans and a heavy heart.<br>
    He had seen firsthand how coffee farmers worked long hours for little pay,
    often without the resources to expand or improve their yields.<br>
<br>
    Over coffee with friends, Bradwen realized that the problem wasn’t a lack of skill,
    but a lack of opportunity.<br>
    He decided to build a coffee brand that would do more than sell great coffee.<br>
    It would invest directly into farming communities by donating coffee seeds,
    providing training,<br>
    and ensuring farmers received fair payment for their beans.<br>
<br>
<b>First Roast (2018)</b>
<br>
    Bradwen started small — roasting beans in his garage and selling them at 
    weekend markets.<br>
    Customers loved the rich, smooth blends, 
    but what truly set Cup of Change apart was its promise:<br>
    for every bag sold, a portion goes toward donating coffee
    seeds and tools to rural farmers in need.<br>
<br>
<b>Growing Roots (2019–2021)</b>
<br>
    With support from loyal customers and local cafés, 
    Cup of Change expanded its sourcing to farmers across Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Colombia.<br>
    Partnerships with agricultural co-ops meant the company 
    could track every seed donated and every job created.<br>
<br>
<b>Going Global (2022–Present)</b>
<br>
    Cup of Change launched its online store, shipping ethically sourced coffee worldwide.
